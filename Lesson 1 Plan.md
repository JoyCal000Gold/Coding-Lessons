# Lesson Plan: Programming Concepts & Analytics Web App

## Webpage One (Homepage): Password Protection

**Objective:**  
Teach basic programming concepts such as if/else, data types, and for loops.

### Learning Goals
- Learn conditional statements (if/else)
- Understand data types (strings, integers, booleans)
- Implement a for loop for navigation (e.g., buttons to switch between sections/pages)

### What to Cover

#### **Password Protection**
- Start with a password prompt using a simple if/else statement.
- The user must input a password to access the next page or section.

#### **For Loop for Navigation**
- Use a for loop to dynamically create navigation buttons.
- In a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit), each button links to a different section/page.
- The user can click a button to move to the next page.

## Webpage: Data

- Working with APIs and static datasets.
- Modifying and filtering data.
- Introduction to Python user interface systems.

---

## Webpage: Analytics

- Python regression analysis.
- R regression and time series analysis.
- Visualizations with R graphs and Python graphics.

---

## Webpage: Reports

- Reporting with R Markdown, PDF, HTML output.
- Using R (Shiny) and Quarto for interactive and static reports.

## Notes

- Each section/page can be implemented as a separate web page or tab in your app.
- Use clear navigation so students can move back and forth between lessons.
- Supplement with hands-on code exercises and quizzes.
