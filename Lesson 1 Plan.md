# Lesson Plan: Programming Concepts & Analytics Web App

## Webpage One (Homepage): Password Protection

**Objective:**  
Teach basic programming concepts such as if/else, data types, and for loops.

### Learning Goals
- Learn conditional statements (if/else)
- Understand data types (strings, integers, booleans)
- Implement a for loop for navigation (e.g., buttons to switch between sections/pages)

### What to Cover

#### **Password Protection**
- Start with a password prompt using a simple if/else statement.
- The user must input a password to access the next page or section.

#### **For Loop for Navigation**
- Use a for loop to dynamically create navigation buttons.
- In a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit), each button links to a different section/page.
- The user can click a button to move to the next page.
