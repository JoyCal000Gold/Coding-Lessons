Lesson Plan
Webpage one (homepage) : Password protection
Objective: Teach basic programming concepts such as if/else loops, data types, and for loops. Learning Goals:
Learn conditional statements (if/else).

Understand data types (strings, integers, booleans).

Implement a for loop to navigate between pages (e.g., buttons to switch between different sections).

What to cover:

**Password Protection:
Start with a password prompt (simple if/else). The user must input a password to access the next page.

**For Loop for Navigation:
Use a for loop to create buttons for moving between pages. In a web app, this could be implemented with Flask or Streamlit, where each page links to another. The user can click a button to move to the next page.

Webpage Data : API, static datasets. Modifying and filtering data, python user interface systems

Webpage Analytics : Python regression, R regression, R timeseries. R graphs and python graphics

Webpage Reports: Report in R markdown, pdf, html (R (Shiny) and Quarto)
