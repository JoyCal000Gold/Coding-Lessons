# **IF AI LESSONS**
1. Mathematical Foundations
AI algorithms hinge on linear algebra, probability, and optimization.

Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, eigenvalues/eigenvectors

Probability & Statistics: distributions, Bayes’ theorem, expectation, variance

Optimization: gradient descent, convex vs. non-convex functions, learning rates

Quick Check: Hand-derive one gradient step for a simple quadratic loss.

2. Data Engineering & Pipelines
Clean, well-structured data is the lifeblood of every AI project.

ETL Processes: extract, transform, load workflows

Feature Engineering: scaling, encoding, normalization

Data Versioning & Lineage: tools like DVC or Delta Lake

Quick Check: Build a tiny pipeline that ingests a CSV, imputes missing values, and writes a cleaned JSON.

3. Core Machine Learning Algorithms
LLMs are one family—students need exposure to others.

Supervised Learning: linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, k-NN

Unsupervised Learning: k-means clustering, PCA, t-SNE

Reinforcement Learning: Markov decision processes, Q-learning basics

Quick Check: Train a k-NN classifier on the Iris dataset and evaluate accuracy.

4. Deep Learning Fundamentals
Transition from “shallow” to “deep” nets before jumping into transformers.

Neural Networks: perceptrons, activation functions, backpropagation

CNNs for Vision: convolution, pooling, image classification

RNNs/LSTMs for Sequence: time-series forecasting, basic language models

Alternative Generative Models: GANs and VAEs

Quick Check: Implement a two-layer neural network in NumPy to classify MNIST digits.

5. Model Evaluation & Selection
Choosing the right metric and validation scheme is critical.

Metrics: precision/recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, RMSE

Cross-Validation & Bootstrapping

Bias-Variance Trade-off and Overfitting Detection

Quick Check: Run k-fold cross-validation on a decision tree and plot learning curves.

6. Frameworks & Tooling
Hands-on AI work relies on standard libraries and platforms.

Python Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch

R Libraries: caret, tidymodels, kerasR

Experiment Tracking: MLflow, Weights & Biases

Quick Check: Log hyperparameters and metrics for two model runs in MLflow.

7. Deployment & MLOps
Productionizing models introduces its own challenges.

Model Serialization: ONNX, SavedModel, PMML

Serving: REST APIs with FastAPI/Flask, TensorFlow Serving

Continuous Training & Monitoring: automated retraining, drift detection

Quick Check: Containerize a trained scikit-learn model with Docker and hit its /predict endpoint.

8. Ethics, Interpretability & Fairness
Responsible AI demands more than raw performance.

Interpretability: SHAP values, LIME

Fairness Metrics: demographic parity, equalized odds

Privacy & Security: differential privacy, adversarial attacks

Quick Check: Use SHAP to explain a single prediction from your logistic regression model.
