# Coding-Lessons

### **1. Analytics Tab: Data Handling, Cleaning, and Graphs**

* **Python**:

  * **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Python is often **faster** for handling large datasets and cleaning them, especially with libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **SciPy**. It also excels at tasks like **missing data imputation**, **data manipulation**, and **filtering**.
  * **API Data Handling**: Python is a great choice for interacting with **APIs** (such as real-time data for electric vehicles), especially with tools like **requests**, **aiohttp**, or even using **data pipelines** like **Airflow**.
  * **Stacking and User Interface**: If you want to implement interactive features (like **adding/deleting buttons**), Python's ecosystem (e.g., **Dash** or **Streamlit**) can handle creating user-friendly interfaces. These tools allow you to add interactivity with buttons, sliders, and other controls to modify data or graphs on the fly.
  * **Graphs**: Python can definitely handle visualizations, and libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** are excellent for creating static and interactive plots. You can also generate **interactive dashboards** using **Dash** or **Streamlit**.

* **R**:

  * **Graphs**: R has **exceptionally powerful** visualization capabilities, particularly for **statistical data**. The **`ggplot2`** package is a gold standard for creating aesthetically pleasing and customizable graphs. R also supports interactive plots through libraries like **plotly** or **shiny**.

  * **R in this case** shines for more complex statistical plots or when you want to apply statistical models to visualizations, like **regression lines**, **boxplots**, **density plots**, or **time series** plots with built-in functionality.

### **2. Reports Tab: Generating Formal Reports**

* **R**:

  * **Reports**: This is where R truly excels, especially with **RMarkdown**. You can create fully dynamic reports that combine **data analysis**, **code**, **plots**, and **text** into one document. You can output these reports in formats like **HTML**, **PDF**, or **Word**, and it supports **LaTeX** for academic-level formatting.

  * R makes it super easy to build **reproducible research**. For example, you can embed code directly into a report, and when the code is executed, the results (including plots) are updated automatically. This is fantastic for **real-time reports** that always reflect the latest data.

  * R can generate **summary statistics**, **tables**, and **formatted graphs**, which can be included directly in reports.

* **Python**:

  * Python can help with reports by exporting data or graphs, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same level of integration for **reproducible research** and **dynamic reports** as R does.
  * However, if you need to create more **automated reports** with **Plotly** or **Jupyter Notebooks**, Python is useful. It can handle the generation of **graphs** and then export them to a static report.
  * Python can assist in the back-end of report generation if you're building a **custom dashboard** or a web-based report with tools like **Flask**, **Dash**, or **Streamlit**, but for **academic-level** formatting and **reproducibility**, **R** remains the **strongest**.

### **3. General Functionality: Integration**

* **Python**:

  * **Backend Logic**: Python would likely handle the **backend** operations for interacting with external data sources (APIs), managing databases, and performing heavy lifting on data analysis or manipulation. Python can also **stack** data in the analytics tab or manage user interactions (like button clicks, toggles, and inputs).

  * **API Integration**: Python is great for pulling real-time data from **APIs** and integrating it with static datasets. You could set up Python functions to **fetch** API data and integrate it into your analysis workflow.

  * **Data Interactivity**: If you want your application to be **interactive**, Python is ideal for creating buttons, dropdowns, and other UI elements that users can interact with to update graphs or data (using **Streamlit**, **Dash**, etc.).

* **R**:

  * **Specialized Analysis**: While Python can do a lot of data analysis, **R** still leads in specialized **statistical analysis**. If you want to dive deep into **statistical tests** or more advanced analysis (like **experimental design**, **time series**, or **hypothesis testing**), **R** would be better.

  * **Integration with Reports**: Once the data is processed and visualized, **RMarkdown** or **Shiny** will help **integrate** the results into user-facing reports or dashboards. **Shiny** can also handle **interactivity** in the context of data visualizations, enabling users to interact with statistical outputs (for example, sliders to adjust model parameters).

### **Summary of Roles**

* **Python**:

  * Great for **data cleaning**, **handling API data**, **user interactivity**, **data manipulation**, and **stacking** data for analysis.
  * Excellent for creating **dynamic dashboards** and web applications with **Streamlit**, **Dash**, or similar frameworks.
  * Can generate **basic reports**, but **R** is more powerful for formatting.

* **R**:

  * Best for **statistical analysis**, **advanced modeling**, **report generation** (especially **reproducible reports** with **RMarkdown**), and generating **professional-level graphs** (with **ggplot2**).
  * Best for **time series forecasting**, **experimental design**, and **statistical reports**.

---

### Example Workflow:

1. **Python handles the backend**: Collects data via APIs, cleans and processes the data, and prepares it for analysis.
2. **R takes care of the analysis**: Performs statistical analysis (like time series forecasting or experimental design), creates sophisticated visualizations, and generates reports.
3. **R or Python handles interactivity**: Use Python for interactive UI elements like buttons, filters, or sliders, or use **Shiny** in R for more advanced interactive visualizations or reports.

# **Lesson Plan**


* Webpage one (homepage) : Password protection
 * Objective: Teach basic programming concepts such as if/else loops, data types, and for loops.
Learning Goals:

Learn conditional statements (if/else).

Understand data types (strings, integers, booleans).

Implement a for loop to navigate between pages (e.g., buttons to switch between different sections).

What to cover:

* **Password Protection:

Start with a password prompt (simple if/else). The user must input a password to access the next page.  

* **For Loop for Navigation:

Use a for loop to create buttons for moving between pages.
In a web app, this could be implemented with Flask or Streamlit, where each page links to another. The user can click a button to move to the next page.


* Webpage Data : API, static datasets. Modifying and filtering data, python user interface systems

* Webpage Analytics : Python regression, R regression, R timeseries. R graphs and python graphics

* Webpage Reports: Report in R markdown, pdf, html (R (Shiny) and Quarto)
